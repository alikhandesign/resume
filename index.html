				<h2>Summary</h2>

				<p>Multi-disciplinary designer, with over 13 years of experience in print and digital design, looking to join a collaborative team, to develop and hone my product design skills, while creating empathetic experiences for users and achieving business goals. A problem-solver at heart, I use research to inform decisions at every step of the design process.</p>

					<h3>Ali Khan Design  &#47;<span class="title">  Freelance Graphic Designer</span></h3>

					<p class="date">January 2008 - Current Austin, Texas</p>

					<p>– The visual effects department at <span class="bold">Netflix</span> employed me to create a logo that
					reflected their creativity as a team while staying true to their parent brand. Although this project wasn’t tied to any specific business goals it led to two other departments hiring me to create logos for their teams.</p>

					<p>– Local food truck, <span class="bold">Rollin Smoke BBQ</span>, hired me to help redesign their look. I
					started by creating a logo which is not only playful but presented them as a serious contender with some nationally recognized brands. Sales have increased steadily since implementing the new brand direction.</p>

					<p>– A new attorney enlisted my services to create a logo for his law firm, <span class="bold">BarnesLaw</span>. He felt that it was important to be viewed as not only an honest lawyer, but an accessible one. This design implemented open letter forms and light gray text to accomplish the task. Since being branded, Barnes Law is a blossoming business with new clients coming in regularly.</p>

					<p>– Michael Druck approached me to design two logos for his casting companies,
					<span class="bold">Michael Druck Casting</span> and <span class="bold">The Extras Factory</span>. Michael Druck has a very “loud’ personality and in an industry where your personality matters so much, it was
					important to convey this in both his logos. Michael Druck is now one of the top
					casting agents in the central Texas area.</p>

					<p>– At <span class="bold">TAVHealth</span> I learned the meaning of being “scrappy” that is to say with a limited budget and resources, and a small marketing team we were able to re-brand and beef up marketing efforts. As a result of our work we were able to generate the first inbound leads in the history of TAVHealth.</p>
